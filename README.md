# Chatbot Testing - README

###Overview:
This project serves as a testing environment to analyze how an agent selects the appropriate tool based on the user's input. The goal is to observe, debug, and optimize tool selection logic in LangChain's agent framework before applying it to the main chatbot.

###ðŸ”¹ Key Focus Areas:

- ðŸ›  Agent Tool Selection: How the agent decides which function to execute.
- ðŸ“Š Handling Different Input Types: Testing function calls with and without parameters.
- ðŸ”„ Automatic Error Handling: Ensuring smooth execution using handle_parsing_errors=True.
